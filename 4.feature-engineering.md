# 4. Feature Engineering

Having the right features is the most important thing in developing an ML system according to practical lessons from predicting clicks on Ads at Facebook.

A large part of many ML engineering and data science jobs is to come up with new useful features.

## Learned Features vs Engineered Features

We are still far from the point where all features can be learned by DL.

## Common Feature Engineering Operations

Handling missiving values, scaling, discertizaiton, encoding categorical features, generating the old-school but still very effective cross features as well as the newer and exciting positional features.

### Handling Missing Values

Not all types of missing values are equal.

If a variable has too many missing values, just remove that variable.

You can also remove an example from the data. However, this is a problem because sometimes you remove data that's important.

You can fill missing data with certain values. Finding those certain values is the hard part.
